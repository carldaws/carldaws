## Senior Software Engineer

I'm a senior software engineer specialising in Ruby on Rails with over a decade of experience building production web applications - as a team lead, a contractor, and a solo developer shipping my own products.

I enjoy owning problems end-to-end: architecting the solution, building it, deploying it, and iterating on it with real users. I welcome opportunities to lead small teams in a hands-on way, mentoring and training less experienced developers.

Technical skills:
- Ruby on Rails (5 through 8, including Hotwire, Stimulus & Turbo Native)
- React (TypeScript, Next.js, Vite), React Native (Expo)
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Sidekiq, Docker, Kamal, AWS
- Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic and custom API integrations
- TDD, CI/CD, code review
